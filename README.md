# What is FLINK?

This is the [Flink demo site](http://cdn.zentric.es/flink/demo) repository. **FLINK** is a small javascript library (10kb zipped) that implements a complete framework for embedded applications on your pages.

## Features

1. No download or installation is required.
2. No dependencies.
3. Available for any (modern) browser.
4. Responsive.
5. Multi lang support.
6. Templates support.
7. Module extensions support.

### Core and sample/Demo modules

FLINK comes with a complete set of ready-to-use core modules:

- Menu. Manage menu panels.
- Locale. Multi lang support.
- Preferences. Customize user preferences.
- View. Utilities for loading and render templates.
- Browser. Load any website into frame.

Furthermore, three sample/demo modules:

- Summary. A summary of Links and Forms info.
- Forms. Forms infomation.
- Links. Links information.

The **Summary**, **Forms** and **Links** (sample and demo) modules are inspired by part of the functionality which was packed whithin the early versions of Firefox. This functionality showed, among others, a list of links and forms present on the page. Later, this feature was removed and, AFAIK, the reason why developers stopped adding it to Firefox remains a mystery to many.

There are several Firefox add-ons that provide that functionality. However, it is quite common that they are deactivated as the browser version is updated. So, I decided to do a small utility, not a Firefox add-on but a javascript application available for any browser. But, in the end, it has become a kind of framework for embedded javascript applications with much more capabilities.
